# Proposal: 0008 - Observability, audit logs and metrics

Summary
-------

Add structured audit logging (request-id), `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints, and basic Prometheus-style counters to improve traceability and monitoring.

Deliverables
------------

1. `spec.md` defining log format and endpoint behaviour.
2. `tasks.md` listing implementation steps and tests.
