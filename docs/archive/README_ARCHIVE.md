README — docs/archive

This folder holds archived documents moved from the top-level `docs/` to
reduce clutter. Files here are read-only snapshots and can be restored to
`docs/` by opening a PR referencing this archive file.

If you see an important file here that should be surfaced at top-level,
please create a small PR and reference `docs/README.md`.
