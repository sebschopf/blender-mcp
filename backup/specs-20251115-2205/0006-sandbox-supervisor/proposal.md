# Proposal: 0006 - Sandboxing & supervisor

Summary
-------

Harden the adapter that launches external workloads by documenting and implementing sandbox modes and a supervisor with restart policies.

Deliverables
------------

1. `spec.md` specifying adapter API, config and acceptance tests (already present).
2. `tasks.md` with concrete implementation steps (already present).
3. A minimal, platform-aware proof-of-concept that demonstrates timeouts and cleanup.
